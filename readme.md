## Project Overview 

At the request of the Colorado Board of Elections, we have completed an election audit 
of the November 2018 Colorado First District congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast. 
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes. 
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received. 
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won. 
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Challenge Overview

In this challenge we faced the task of using Python to import text data and 
perform some simple analysis on that data. Election data from the 2018 General 
Election for Colorado's 1st Congressional District was provided in a comma-
deliniated text file.

The data was processed to find the total vote counts and percentage of the 
vote for each candidate. Additionally, we were asked to represent the largest 
voting county in the district.

##Election-Audit Summary: 

With our elections coming under the most intense scrutiny in history, it is 
more important than ever that elections officials provide as much transpeancy
as possible. To that end, PSyber PSamurais proposes to provide full-service  
auditing for your elections office.

With our not very proprietary but very flexible Python-based analysis we can
easily pull the information you want to see from very large datasets like vote
records. 

With access to the full vote record of each ballot, we are able to 
provide analysis on undervotes, or instances where voters chose to vote in one 
race but not another. We would also be able to see unusual voting patterns, such 
as large blocks of votes for the same candidate being dumped into the data at the 
same time. 

Psyber PSamurais is your one-stop shop for both creating doubt, and putting those 
doubts at ease in our modern election cycle!
